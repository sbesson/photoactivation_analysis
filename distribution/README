This bundle contains the series of scripts used to produce the analysis
of Young et al. All scripts are written under MATLAB and have been tested
using MATLAB R2013b. The following MATLAB toolboxes are required to run all
the components:
- Curve Fitting Toolbox
- Image Processing Toolbox
- Mapping Toolbox
- Optimization Toolbox
- Statistics Toolbox

The bundle contains 3 directories:
- the `spindleAnalysis` directory contains the scripts used to align the 
  spindle width/length measurements. The startup script is called 
  `runSpindleAnalysis` and looks for XLS files containing time-series of the
  spindle lengths.

- the `photoactivation` directory contains the scripts used to process the 
  spindle photoactivation experiments into flux/turnover measurements. It 
  assumes the data has been imported onto an OMERO server and makes extensive
  use of the OMERO.matlab toolbox 

- the `extern` directory contains third-party MATLAB functions under   
  GPL-license used for running the code.
